Define two distances: Dc for content and Ds for style.
Dc measures how different the content is between two images.
Ds measures the style difference between two images.
Then create a third imge and transform it to minimize the Dc with
content image (anime.jpg) and the Ds with style image (claudemonet.jpg)
